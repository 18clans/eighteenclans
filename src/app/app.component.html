    <strong>Hmong 18 Council Alcohol Consumption Guideline</strong>
  </h1>
  <p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >Overview of Alcohol Consumption in the Hmong Community:<br /></strong
    >Alcohol consumption is responsible for an estimated 100,000 deaths in the
    United States due to alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes, cirrhosis,
    violence, and unintentional injuries. Alcohol usage within the Hmong
    community is an integral part of cultural practices in wedding negotiations
    and ceremonies, funeral services, and religious or spiritual rituals.
    Alcohol is also an acceptable norm in social engagements since it has
    <code>long</code> been a part of Hmong way of living in expressing respect
    and building friendship.

  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
    <li>There should be NO peer pressure to consume alcohol and/or liquor.</li>
    <li>A "12 (twelve) oz" or more beer should not be consumed in one shot.</li>
    <li>
      The guest(s) and/or attendee(s) should NOT be penalized for not finishing
      a drink Toaster should not force individuals to drink with him/her by
      stating: "drink as I drink," or "I need the can/bottle back!" (This
      results in peer pressure in drinking and/or alcohol abuse). There should
      be NO pressure, and it should be up to the guest(s) or attendee(s) how
      he/she likes to drink or be exempt from drinking without penalty.
      Attendees should be allowed to drink Pepsi products, juice, water, or

      attend with you. When you're under the influence of alcohol, you must call
      a family member, friend, or Uber/taxi to drive you home. &nbsp;
